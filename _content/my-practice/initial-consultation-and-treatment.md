### Initial Consultation & Treatment

Your initial treatment is a Private Consultation for 1.5 hours. You will complete your intake form and we will discuss your complaint. I will come up with a treatment plan. We will set up a realistic appointment and pay schedule. Then you will receive a lovely hour long treatment.

<!-- Your follow-up treatments are each an hour and tailored to your main complaint. There will be less talking and more relaxing and receiving. You will come and get comfortable. You will receive acupuncture and massage, and rest with an eye cover, a blanket and soothing music. -->
