### Follow-Up Treatments
Your follow-up treatments are each an hour and tailored to your main complaint. There will be less talking and more relaxing and receiving. You will come and get comfortable. You will receive acupuncture, massage, ultra sound, and rest with an eye cover, a blanket and soothing music.
