#### During the process of healing my broken leg 2x, and being exposed to many healing arts,

I realized that I was being called to serve more than just myself. My story is about how the same techniques used to bring me back to health are the same ones I use in my practice. I felt deeply compelled to study them, with the intention to literally improve  your life too!
