Iâ€™m from Tofino and Victoria, on Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, Canada. I have been practicing Acupuncture since 2000. I am Nationally Board Certified and Licensed in Montana. In 2000, I graduated from The Canadian College of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. Then I attended countless seminars and educated my clients.
