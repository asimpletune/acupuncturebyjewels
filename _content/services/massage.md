#### Massage

{:.text-muted}
The combination of doing massage and acupuncture is not only a treat but deeply therapeutic.

I use an ancient system taught by a master called "reverse mirror imaging", which allows me to balance the pain or diseased area by distally needling the opposite limb, allowing me to directly massage the pain area, resulting in deeper healing.
