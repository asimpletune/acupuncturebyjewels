#### Acupuncture

{:.text-muted}
Acupuncture is a key component of Traditional Chinese Medicine, involving the insertion of thin needles in the body at pressure points. Unlike Traditional Western Medicine, the focus of acupuncture is to heal holistically, targeting the root, underlying causes of pain, internal imbalances, and other, systemic issues.
